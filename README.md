# Project-6
 Game Show App
 "Guess that phrase game" with overlays to reset or stop gameplay
## How I worked on this project
My goal was to simulate a professional work environment.
- I built this app based on mockup images.
## How to navigate this project
- App can be accessed through the index.html file.
- Responsive styling with CSS.
## Why I built the project this way
- My plan is to become a full-stack developer, but this project focuses on the
  frontend. That's why an array was used to store the phrases.
## If I had more time I would change this
- Connect to a database to retrieve phrases from a larger selection.
